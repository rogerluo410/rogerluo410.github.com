	<h1>The most effective way to learn to code</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>The most effective way to learn to code really depends on your motivation for learning. What’s yours? Pick one…<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="i-work-with-programmers-i8217d-like-to-be-able-to-communicate-with-them-better">I work with programmers, I’d like to be able to communicate with them better</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Find a coder coworker that you get on well with—one that does a good job of explaining technical subjects to non-techies.</li>
  <li>First, ask what technologies the team is using. Write these down.</li>
  <li>Then ask them to describe to you what each of those technologies does (e.g. What does Ruby on Rails do?), and how they come together to solve your business’s problem. Draw it out if that helps. Don’t let terms like Javascript, MySQL and API intimidate you, if they use terminology that you don’t understand, ask them to explain. (e.g. what does an API do?)</li>
  <li>Afterwards, if you’re interested in digging into these more, look up the technologies on <a href="www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> or <a href="www.coderschool.com">CoderSchool</a> and check out the overview classes on them.</li>
  <li>Ask your coworker follow up questions on anything you’re having difficult understanding. They’ll likely be happy to help out.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="i-want-to-find-out-what-it8217s-like-to-be-a-coder">I want to find out what it’s like to be a coder</h2>

<p>Give <a href="www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> a go. It’s a very low barrier to entry way to see what coding is like. It provides you wth a very accessible development environment to hack around in. <a href="www.coderschool.com">CoderSchool</a> is great too, for when you’d like to go a little deeper.</p>

<h2 id="i-want-to-build-a-website">I want to build a website</h2>

<p>If your goal is to eventually produce a live website, then <a href="www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> isn’t the best starting point. Instead you need to <em>learn how to use the real tools required to build a website</em>.</p>

<p>There are a ton of awesome books, tutorials and guides that will take you from zero knowledge through tutorials to build a functional website. These are great fun, and by the time you’re finished the tutorials you’ll be primed to build your own site. A couple of great options:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Build-Your-Website-Right-Using/dp/0987090852">Build Your Own Website The Right Way Using HTML &amp; CSS</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189">HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you prefer to learn via video tutorials <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/">TeamTreehouse</a> is fantastic. For a free option I really like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston/videos?flow=grid&amp;view=1">TheNewBoston’s Youtube Playlists</a>. Both will take you from absolutely zero knowledge to a working website.</p>

<h2 id="i-want-to-build-a-web-application">I want to build a web application</h2>

<p>Don’t spend too much time picking a framework. Just jump in there and get on with it. There’s a lot of great documentation and tutorials out there for Rails.</p>

<p>I really recommend the <a href="https://peepcode.com/products/meet-rails-3-i">Meet Rails 3 tutorials on Peepcode</a>. Yes, they’re $12 each, but are really worth it. They’ll get you going from the ground up, including installing the framework.</p>

<p>After that I’d recommend reading <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book">Learn Web Development With Rails</a>, the online copy is free! The paper copy is available on Amazon too. Alternatively hit up <a href="http://www.railscasts.com">RailsCasts</a> or <a href="http://railsforzombies.org">Rails For Zombies</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">Rails Guides</a> is another great option too.</p>

<h2 id="i8217m-a-designer-i8217d-like-to-understand-how-websites-are-built">I’m a designer, I’d like to understand how websites are built</h2>

<p>You’ll like this book, it’s designed beautifully and explains concepts very clearly:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189">HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Also, consider buddying up with a coder to help you out. Check out <a href="http://hackerbuddy.com">HackerBuddy</a>.</p>

<h2 id="i-want-to-build-an-app">I want to build an app</h2>

<p>I’ve not built any apps so can’t recommend any resources from first hand use, but the following should be good bets:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/B005SN8LL4">Head First: iPhone Development</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-ios">CodeSchool: Try iOS</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/learning-adventures/learn-to-build-iphone-apps">TeamTreeHouse: Learn to build iPhone apps</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="i-want-to-become-a-software-developer">I want to become a software developer</h2>

<p>This is a tougher one and could warrant a longer post! Being a software developer isn’t just about learning a programming language. It’s important to think/learn about problem solving, debugging, communication, and many other things. <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Splosky’s reading lists</a> are a great place to start.</p>

<p>Any other motivations that aren’t covered above?</p>
